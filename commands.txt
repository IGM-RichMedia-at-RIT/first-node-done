=====Node========
The node command actually starts up the node server invoking the file specified as the main program.

Command: 
node  filepath/filenameOfMainProgram

Example: 
node  ./src/main.js

======NPM========
NPM is the Node Package Manager. NPM is used to install, configure and run packages. 
Your code is also a package that will be handled by the package manager.

Commands:
npm init 
--------
The npm init command creates (initializes) a new node project. 
The init command asks basic questions about the project 
such as the name, description, main program file (entry point), 
git repo, author, license, etc. 
This commands creates a package.json for the application. 
Inside of the package.json file created by npm init, there is a section for scripts.
This section holds scripts used by node under certain commands. 

Example:
name: (first node) first-node
version: (0.0.0)
description: Our first node project
entry point: (index.js) main.js
test command: 
git repository:
keywords: NPM Node Intro

license: (ISC) Proprietary 


npm start
--------
The npm start command fires the start script inside of the package.json file.
By default this command does not do anything. You have to add a start script to the package.json file.

For example inside of the package.json, your start script might look like this.
"scripts": {
  "start": "node ./src/index.js",
  "pretest": "eslint  ./src  --fix",
  "test": "echo \"Tests complete\"
}
  
In this case, the start script above would fire when the 'npm start' command is run. 

npm test
=================
The npm test command kicks off the pretest and test scripts inside of the package.json file.
By default, this command does not do anything. You have to add test and pretest 
scripts to the package.json file.

For example inside of the package.json, your start script might look like this.
"scripts": {
  "start": "node ./src/index.js",
  "pretest": "eslint  ./src  --fix",
  "test": "echo \"Tests complete\"
}
  
In this case, the test script above would fire the pretest script and run eslint against the src folder
and then run the test script (which in the above example just prints "tests complete".
